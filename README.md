# Tic-Tac-Pro: A Rational Tic-Tac-Toe Player
### CSC613M (Introduction to Intelligent Systems) MC2

The main objective of the "Tic-Tac-Toe" project is to implement a tic-tac-toe playing rational agent that is able to play and win a game of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent or another rational agent.

The intelligent system created should be able to demonstrate three different levels of rational behaviour or intelligence as follows:
<br> ***a. Level 0***: The agent makes random but valid moves
<br> ***b. Level 1***: The rational agent should be able to demonstrate a "strategy" on playing the game which may make use of a hard-coded table of moves
<br> ***c. Level 2***: The rational agent should be able to use a search strategy to find the "best" move given the current configuration using some simple heuristics or memory.
